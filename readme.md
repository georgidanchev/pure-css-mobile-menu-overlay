This microproject is based on this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/DZg6UfS5zYg). It's really interesting as it allows you to open an overlay menu without javascript. You'd be thinking how is that even possible? Are you serious? Yes. No Javascript. It's no magic at all actually, the pseudo check is used to determine whether you are clicking a checkbox which is right over the menu button, but it's invisible. If it's checked, show the menu. It's that simple, very, very really clever solution. I'd use it in the future.
