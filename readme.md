This micro project is based on this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/DZg6UfS5zYg). It's really intresting as it allows you to open a overaly menu without javascript. You'd be thinking how is that even possible? Are you serious? Yes. No Javascript. It's no magic at all acutally, the pseudo check is used to determain wheather you are clicking a checkbox which is right over the menu button, but it's invisible. If it's checked, show the menu. It's that simple, very, very really clearver solution. I'd use it in the future.
